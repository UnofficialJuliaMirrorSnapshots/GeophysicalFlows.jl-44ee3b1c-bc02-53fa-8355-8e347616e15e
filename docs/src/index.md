## Overview

`GeophysicalFlows.jl` is a collection of modules which leverage the 
[FourierFlows.jl](https://github.com/FourierFlows/FourierFlows.jl) framework to provide
solvers for problems in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, on periodic domains and using Fourier-based pseudospectral methods.

## Developers

FourierFlows is currently being developed by [Navid C. Constantinou](http://www.navidconstantinou.com) and [Gregory L. Wagner](https://glwagner.github.io).
